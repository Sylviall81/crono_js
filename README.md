# Analog Stopwatch 🕒

This project aims to create a simple analog stopwatch with basic functionalities. The stopwatch will feature a seconds hand that completes one full rotation in real-time minute. It will display only seconds, not minutes. Additionally, it will include start/pause and reset buttons.

## Features 🚀

- **Seconds Hand:** A hand that completes one full rotation in real-time minute to mark the elapsed seconds.
- **Control Buttons:** Buttons to start/pause and reset the stopwatch.
- **Adjustable Size:** The size of the stopwatch will be adjustable based on the implementation.
- **Animations:** Buttons will have animations to simulate movement when pressed.
- **Fixed Colors:** The colors of the stopwatch will be fixed.
- **Canvas Element:** The Canvas element of HTML will be utilized, managed with JavaScript scripts for implementation.

## Final Appearance 🎨

The final appearance of the stopwatch will resemble the following design:

## Objective 🎯

The primary objective of this project is to ensure the stopwatch functions correctly, counting time intervals accurately. Additionally, buttons will be animated to visually indicate when they are pressed and released.

## Potential Uses 🌟

This stopwatch can be used as an auxiliary tool in various virtual experiments, such as:

- Study of the movement of a falling object.
- Calculation of velocities.
- Investigation of the pendulum.
- Other experiments related to time and motion.

Explore and utilize this stopwatch for any purpose you can imagine! Its simplicity and versatility make it suitable for a variety of educational and practical applications.
